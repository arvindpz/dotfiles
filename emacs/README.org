#+TITLE: README
This is my repository to keep track of my progress in Emacs!

*** Run the below for stowing.
#+begin_src shell
stow --ignore='^[^.].*$' emacs  # Yea, its ugly
#+end_src

*** Issues:/
It is still not plug and play. Following are some of the issues you may face.
***** gls not found
Comment out the below line if you're not in OSX.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(insert-directory-program "ls")   ; ls in OSX can't group contents by type. Use gls from coreutils
#+end_src

***** org-tempo not found
#+begin_example
M-x packages-list-packages    (for some reason, package-install doesn't list org)
search and install 'org'
#+end_example

*** Things you can expect sometime soon
  - Detailed description of Init.org along with their usage
  - Achieve plug and play

*** Footnotes
I am fairly a beginner in Emacs, so if you think, there are better ways to do/achieve some functionalities, please do let me know.

And I would like to thank [[https://github.com/daviwil][David Wilson]] and everyone else, who inspired me to start with Emacs.
